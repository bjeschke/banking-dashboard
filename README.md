# Banking Dashboard

A simple banking dashboard built with React and TypeScript.

## Getting Started

First, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

Then navigate into the project folder and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd banking-dashboard
npm install
```

To start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The app should now be running at http://localhost:3000

## Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```

Or if you want to watch for changes:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

For coverage reports:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized build in the `build` folder.
